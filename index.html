here below is my HTML code, followed by my CSS and then my JavaScript. i am in the process of creating a section called Rubix. In this section, I want to teach people how to solve a Rubix cube. the way I want it to work I want to incorporate it into my already written general javascript syntax, but I want to create this section in the way that each image will be embedded in an article with an image with the general class of "img" and a paragraph text describing what to do. In the modal when I select said image, I want the image to be selected and made the main image as I already programmed in my javascript code, as that image from my modal images, is made the image then and only then do i want my text describing how to solve it, that i originally kept in my paragraph previously to show. How do i go about this part. Below is my html, css and Javascript code in the same listed order so that you understand what i have done and how to build on it.
